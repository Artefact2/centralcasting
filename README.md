This program doesn't replace the book! It just does most of the work
for you. It's up to you to read in detail what each of the results
mean, in terms of roleplaying.

Dependencies
============

PHP 7.1.

Usage
=====

Generate a PC:

~~~
./cast pc
~~~

To Do
=====

* Finish all the tables!
* Explain how to extend tables and how to write scripts
* Write scripts for NPCs, evil guys, good guys, etc.
* ~~A tree-like structure for table results (better for nested things)~~
* ~~Keep a lot more state (children, parents, etc.) to avoid nonsensical results~~ (Still improvable)
* ~~Proper encapsulation! Code is a mess right now~~ (Still improvable)
* ~~Generate a huge directed graph of all table connections~~
* (Maybe) Web interface
* (Maybe) Make a pre-filled character sheet
